This folder contains papers and codes on models with durable goods, housing and 
non-convexities, and related solution methods.

v1: Initial version with pure discretization

v2: State variables (x,d) on coarse grid,
    choices (x',d') on a finer grid. Use bilinear interp.
    See Gourio and Miao (RED, 2011) for a similar solution method.

v3: Giulio Fella's method. Discrete grid over d and interp over x.
